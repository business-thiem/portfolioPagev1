-built on NextJS and TailWindCSS

An entertaining read below for bosses that read documentations of future SWEs of their company. And it's also my cheatsheet

## Why NextJS?
#### Because SERVER-SIDE RENDERING. 
- Great for SEO
- Cuts out redundancy of React

### Why TailWindCSS? 
#### TailWind is like Bootstrap, but smarter, and adaptively thin .css file
- It provides utility CSS classes so you can get back to programming logic, not playing with CSS styles for 5 hours while your boss is asking you why 5yr Timmy programmed the Mars rover but you can't get text centered on a page.
- It is smart and implements "treeshaking" (https://markmurray.co/blog/tree-shaking-css-modules/) and removes the utilities that aren't used making your CSS file thinner
